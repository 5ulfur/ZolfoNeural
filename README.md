ZolfoNeural is a library written in C for **Neural Networks** that I'm writing as I learn.
The library aims to be **simple** to use but at the same time **complete** and that allows you to **customize** the creation of your own neural network as much as possible.

### To-do:
- Add more activation functions
- Add optimization algorithms
- Write Documentation
- Add things to do

## Features
- Create neural networks with more than one hidden layer
- Choose different activation functions for each layer
